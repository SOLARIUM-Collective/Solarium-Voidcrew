/**
 * Voidcrew: overmap-scale points of interest on the ghost orbit menu.
 *
 * Ghosts could already track a nuke disk but had no way to pick a ship to watch, which is
 * the one thing most observers actually want to do here. Ships are created and destroyed
 * all round long, so rather than registering points of interest at ship creation and
 * chasing every lifecycle edge (hull destroyed, NPC ship claimed at the helm, ship
 * abandoned), the whole set is re-synced every time the orbit menu builds its data. The
 * list is therefore always current as of the moment the ghost opened or refreshed it.
 *
 * The POI is the ship's mobile docking port rather than its overmap marker. The marker
 * lives on the overmap z-level, so orbiting it would park the ghost on a strategic map;
 * the docking port sits on the hull, so following one drops you aboard. The port carries
 * the ship's name and set_ship_name() keeps the two in sync, so renames are picked up for
 * free - get_other_pois() reads the name live.
 *
 * This file also files Voidcrew's own landmarks into their own categories instead of
 * leaving them buried in Misc (see poi_category() in code/modules/mob/dead/observer/orbit.dm):
 * hulls -> Ships, the system star and trader outpost interiors -> Maps. Both register
 * themselves as points of interest at their own lifecycle edges (stars.dm, trade/outpost_orbit.dm).
